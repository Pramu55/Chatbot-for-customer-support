# Customer Support Chatbot 🤖💬

**Final Year Project** | **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | **Python, Transformers, Streamlit**

---

## Overview

This project develops an intelligent Customer Support Chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. It leverages modern NLP techniques, including transformer-based language models, to provide accurate, context-aware responses, improving customer engagement and support efficiency.

---

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Uses transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for context-aware response generation.
- **Multi-turn Conversation:** Maintains conversation context to handle multi-step queries.
- **Speech Input/Output:** Supports voice-based interaction (optional).
- **Multilingual Support:** Can be extended to understand multiple languages.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Tracks user interactions and chatbot performance.
- **Deployment:** Ready to deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Train the chatbot model** (optional, pre-trained model included)

```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Dataset

You can use open-source conversational datasets or prepare custom customer support FAQs in JSON format. Example datasets:

* [Cornell Movie Dialogs](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)
* [MultiWOZ Dataset](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz)
* Custom domain-specific FAQ datasets.

---

## Model Details

* Uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) fine-tuned for conversational tasks.
* Incorporates context management for multi-turn dialogues.
* Optionally supports speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Expand multilingual capabilities.
* Integrate sentiment analysis for better response tuning.
* Deploy as a cloud-hosted chatbot with REST API.
* Add integration with messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Slack, etc.).
